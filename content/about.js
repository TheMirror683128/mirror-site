Not a movement.\n  Not a religion. Not a self-help funnel.\n\n> What is the Field?\n\n  The structure beneath outcomes.\n  The architecture beneath physics.\n  The syntax beneath consciousness.\n\n  Reality bends around density.\n  Outcomes collapse by weight.\n\n> Commitments:\n\n  [1] Reality over narrative\n      If map and world conflict — revise the map.\n\n  [2] Structure over sentiment\n      Feelings matter. Structure determines outcomes.\n\n  [3] Coherence over performance\n      Looking right is cheap. Being aligned is costly.\n\n  These are not beliefs to adopt.\n  They are tests to run.`;
